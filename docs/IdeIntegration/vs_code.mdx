# VS Code

Gleece uses Golang comments for annotating controllers and routes.

The Gleece VS Code extension is designed to improve development experience by providing intelligent annotation support. 

It parses your `gleece.config.json` configuration file, analyzes and highlights annotations in real-time, and provides immediate feedback for any potential issues.

## Features

- **Syntax Highlighting**: Improved readability of Gleece-specific elements
- **Real-time Processing**: Instant visual feedback as you write
- **Warning & Error Indicators**: Real-time markers and tips
- **Documentation Tooltips**: Instant documentation on hover for Gleece elements
- **Parameter Hints**: Function parameter information and suggestions
- **Code Actions**: Quick fixes and refactoring suggestions
