# Visual Studio Code

While *Gleece*'s comment-based annotation format is designed to be intuitive and familiar, it still requires some taking used to.

The *Gleece Visual Studio Code* extension provides useful functionality and diagnostics to simplify and enrich your development experience.


It parses your `gleece.config.json` configuration file, analyzes and highlights annotations in real-time, and provides immediate feedback for any potential issues.

## Features

- **Syntax Highlighting**: Improved readability of Gleece-specific elements
- **Warning & Error Indicators**: Real-time markers and tips
- **Documentation Tooltips**: Instant documentation on hover for Gleece elements
- **Parameter Hints**: Function parameter information and suggestions
- **Configuration highlighting**: Provides information about configuration entries and provides autocompletion
- **Code Actions**: Quick fixes and refactoring suggestions

## Visual Preview

## Quick Start

1. Launch VS Code and open the Extensions sidebar (Ctrl+Shift+X / Cmd+Shift+X)
2. Search for `Gleece` in the marketplace
3. Click `Install` to add the extension to your environment

For more details and updates, visit the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=haim-kastner.gleece-extension).

## Configuration

`Gleece` comes with a few handy configuration options, accessible via *VS Code*'s `Settings` page.

* *Config Path*
  - **Description**: Controls where the extension looks for the `gleece.config.json` file.
   Please note that file name changes may cause configuration linting to fail due to limitations with the *VS Code* API.
  - **Type**: `string`
  - **Default**: `./gleece.config.json`
  - **Key**: `gleece.config.path`

* *Enable Symbolic Awareness*
  - **Description**: Controls whether symbolic analysis is enabled.

    Symbolic analysis provides contextual, in depth error checking and highlighting as well as features
	like controller summaries and route overviews.

	It is recommended to enable this feature for the best experience.

	For in depth information, see the [Symbolic Analysis](#symbolic-awareness) sub-section
  - **Type**: `boolean`
  - **Default**: `true`
  - **Key**: `gleece.analysis.enableSymbolicAwareness`

* *Analysis Mode*
  - **Description**: Controls whether the extension fully re-analyzes files on every change or attempts a differential analysis.
    It is recommended to use `full` for the most robust experience.
  - **Type**: `full`, `differential`
  - **Default**: `full`
  - **Key**: `gleece.analysis.mode`


### Symbolic Awareness

:::note
This is an advanced topic, addressed mainly at developers interested in the inner workings of the extension.
:::

Symbolic awareness analyzes your code to produce in depth, contextual information about controllers and receivers.

It serves as the basis for a multitude of useful features:

* *Controller/Receiver Context*
  - *Annotation placement*
    Certain annotations can only be applied to either a controller or a receiver.
    An example could be `@Tag`. Tags are valid only for controllers.

    With symbolic awareness enabled, controllers missing `@Tag` annotations will have a warning attached
    to them (as it is recommended to provide explicit tags to all controllers) while receivers will be highlighted with an error
    as they do not accept tags.

  - *Controller summary*
    Controller summary is a nifty little feature that presents a table of all controller functions, their HTTP verbs and their routes.
