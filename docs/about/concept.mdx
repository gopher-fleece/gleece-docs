# Philosophy and Concept


APIs are a cornerstone of many applications - they provides means for parties such as application developers or customers
to access your services and are often the 'face' of the product.

Even the best of intentions, designs and implementations are often defeated by the sheer grinding force of day-to-day operations;
Services change, developers come and go, integrations are formed and abandoned and the effort of maintaining our APIs in these conditions
grows ever larger.

Badly written or poorly maintained APIs frustrate everyone - they create constant friction where there should be none.


*Gleece* aims to alleviate these pressures by providing quick and simple yet powerful development workflows
whilst taking care of most of the 'dirty' maintenance work for you.

<br />

*Gleece*'s distinction is that it achieves this in an **almost purely design-time manner**.

By combining rich, **fully deterministic**, code analysis faculties with industry standard tools and libraries 
(such as the excellent [libopenapi](https://github.com/pb33f/libopenapi)) and a templating system, *Gleece* is able to generate, prior to build,
fully working router code and matching OpenAPI schema.

This allows us to generate optimized, *reflection*-free
(depending on configuration - the internal [validator](https://github.com/go-playground/validator) **can** use it)
code that is similar to human-written code in that it is completely readable and deterministic and can perform a wide
range of tasks that would otherwise require large amounts of boilerplate or fragile code.


By reducing the amount of boilerplate code developers have to write and engage with, we can significantly reduce the risk for
several major pitfalls of API maintenance:

* Missing authentication/authorization
* Mismatched types/structs
* Missing or mismatched documentation
* Invalid OpenAPI schemas
* Spaghetti code

<br />

But that's only part of the story;
APIs, especially enterprise grade, require a whole slew of highly specialized features, often uniquely tailored to the specific application,
or, put plainly, the worst thing a framework can do is prevent you from getting work done **your way**.

As such, we've designed *Gleece* to be almost entirely un-opinionated and highly extensible.
It Supports:

* Most major routers in a "bring your own router" manner.

* Various 'hooks' that can be run at different stages of each request such as before/after/on error.

* Template extensions which allow for quick and precise behavioral controls without sacrificing compatibility with future updates

* Template overrides which confer the ability to perform sweeping/low granularity changes over the generated routes
  such as the addition of telemetry.

* Template context injections - combined with template overrides, allows you to effectively develop custom annotations
  and behaviors to intimately tailor each and every aspect of the generated routes.

* *Extremely* thin, no-dependency runtime layer - you are in full control of your dependencies (SSDLC, anyone?)

<br />

If you've read this far - thank you!

We hope you enjoy working with *Gleece*
