# Routing

Gleece is designed to minimize HTTP routing boilerplate code, allowing developers to focus on business logic.

A route is essentially a function within a controller that is annotated with the `@Route` annotation.

## Creating a Controller

First, create a controller struct that extends the GleeceController from Gleece's runtime. Annotate the controller with the base routing path, which will serve as the prefix for all routes in that controller.

You can also set the security schema and scopes for the entire controller (these can be overridden per route later).

```go
import "github.com/gopher-fleece/runtime"

// @Route(/base-path)
// @Security(securitySchemaName, { scopes: ["read"] })
type ExampleController struct {
    runtime.GleeceController // Embedding the GleeceController to inherit its methods
}
```

## Creating a Route

Create a function in the controller to handle the logic and annotate it with the `@Method` and `@Route` annotations:

```go
// @Method(GET)
// @Route(/simple-get)
func (ec *ExampleController) SimpleGet() (string, error) {
    return "works", nil
}
```

To access data from the HTTP request, add parameters to the function along with corresponding annotations indicating their source:

```go
// @Method(GET)
// @Route(/simple-get)
// @Query(name, { validate: "required" })
// @Response(200)
func (ec *ExampleController) SimpleGet(name string) (string, error) {
    return "Hello " + name, nil
}
```

#### Parameters can be sourced from:

- `@Query`     - Query parameters in the URL
- `@Path`      - URL path parameters
- `@Header`    - HTTP headers
- `@Body`      - Request body
- `@FromField` - Request urlencoded form fields

Multiple instances of `@Query`, `@Path`, `@FromField`, and `@Header` annotations are allowed in a single route. 

However, only one `@Body` annotation is allowed per route.

:::info
### Parameter Types

- **Primitive Types**: All primitive types (and their pointer variants) are supported across all parameter sources (except for `@Body`). This includes type aliases and custom enum types.
- **Struct Types**: Only supported when used with the `@Body` parameter. Both individual structs and slices of structs are fully supported.

:::

:::warning
#### Body Processing Constraints

The `@Body` and `@FromField` annotations should not be used together in the same route as they represent different approaches to processing the request body payload:

- `@FromField` - Processes individual fields from `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` request payload
- `@Body` - Processes complete `application/json` request payload
:::

## Response Types

Route handlers in Gleece follow a consistent return pattern. While the return type is optional, when specified, it should be a tuple in the form of `(<response type>, error)`:

- The first value represents the response payload that will be serialized to JSON
- The second value indicates any error that occurred during processing

The response payload can be:
- Primitive types (string, int, bool, etc.)
- Struct types (custom objects)
- Slices of any supported type
- Pointers to any of the above

> Note that `map` is not supported as response types.

## Complete Example

Here's a comprehensive example of a controller with annotated routes:

```go title="example.ctrl.go"
package controllers

import (
    "github.com/google/uuid"
    "github.com/gopher-fleece/runtime"
)

// @Description Example object
type Example struct {
    // @Description Some text
    Text string `json:"text" validate:"required"`
    // @Description Some number
    Number int `json:"number" validate:"gte=1"`
}

// @Tag(Example)
// @Route(/base-path)
// @Security(securitySchemaName, { scopes: ["read"] })
// @Description The Example API
type ExampleController struct {
    runtime.GleeceController
}

// @Description Create an example
// @Method(POST)
// @Route(/logic/{example_name}/{example_id})
// @Query(email, { validate: "required,email" }) The exampler email
// @Path(id, { name: "example_id", validate:"gt=1" }) The example ID
// @Path(name, { name: "example_name" }) The example's name
// @Body(example) The example object
// @Header(origin, { name: "x-origin" }) The request origin
// @Header(trace) The trace ID
// @Response(200) The new ID of the example
// @ErrorResponse(500) Error when processing fails
// @Security(securitySchemaName, { scopes: ["read", "write"] })
func (ec *ExampleController) ExampleLogic(
    id int,
    email string,
    name string,
    origin string,
    trace *string,
    example Example) (string, error) {
    newId := uuid.New()
    return example.Text + " " + newId.String(), nil
}
```

:::warning
### Cross-Package Type Usage

While structs and type aliases in API routes can be declared in any package, including external imported packages, the type names must be unique across all API routes.

Using the same struct name from different packages is not supported.

For example, if you have `package1.User` and `package2.User`, you can use only one of them across all API routes.
