# Override Template

While extending templates is the recommended approach for most customizations, template overriding gives you complete control over the generated routes by replacing the core templates with your custom implementations.

This approach is particularly useful for scenarios that require deep customization, such as:
- Implementing custom validation logic
- Adding specialized authorization flows
- Completely restructuring route handling

**Important Note About Updates**

When overriding Gleece core templates, you won't receive automatic updates when the package is updated.

If you need functionality from newer versions, you'll need to manually merge changes from the updated core templates into your custom implementations.

:::

## Configuration

To override a template, locate the original template in your engine's directory. For example, if you're using the `gin` engine, the templates are available at: 
[gin templates](https://github.com/gopher-fleece/gleece/tree/main/generator/templates/gin)

Configure your override by adding the template name and the path to your custom implementation in the `routesConfig->templateOverrides` map:

```json title="gleece.config.json"
"routesConfig": {
    "engine": "gin",
    "templateOverrides": {
        "ResponseHeaders": "./gin.custom.response.headers.hbs"
    }
},
```

:::info

**Template Discovery**

All available templates can be found in your engine's `embeds.go` file:
- The main entry point template is named `Routes`
- Additional templates are listed in the `Partials` map
- For reference, check the gin engine's [embeds.go](https://github.com/gopher-fleece/gleece/blob/main/generator/templates/gin/embeds.go)

:::tip

Using an invalid template name? Don't worry! Gleece will respond with a helpful error message listing all available template names during the build process.

:::

## Generate With Overrides

After configuring your template overrides, rebuild routes using `Gleece`

It will regenerate all routes using your custom templates where specified, while maintaining the default templates for non-overridden templates.
