# Experimental Features

:::danger Disclaimer

The following features are experimental and may change in future versions.

Please do not use them unless you understand the risks and the potential changes that may occur.

## Enum Validation

Enums in Go are tricky. There is no "real" enum type in Go, but aliases of primitive types can be "extended" with predefined values to act as enums.

This means that the only validation that comes out of the box using `go-playground/validator` is that the value matches the type of the alias, but not that it is one of the predefined values.

To validate that a value is within the allowed enum values, you need to add an `oneof` validation to the field's tag.

For example, the following code:
```go
type MyEnum string

const (
    MyEnumValue1 MyEnum = "value1"
    MyEnumValue2 MyEnum = "value2"
)

type MyStruct struct {
    MyEnumField MyEnum `json:"myEnumField" validate:"required"`
}
```

Will validate that the `MyEnumField` is a string, but not that it is one of the predefined values.

To validate that the value is one of the predefined values, the following tag should be added to the field:
```go
type MyStruct struct {
    MyEnumField MyEnum `json:"myEnumField" validate:"required,oneof=value1 value2"`
}
```

This ensures that `MyEnumField` is one of the predefined values.

However, having to specify the available values in each usage is error-prone and violates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. Any change to the enum requires updating all validation tags throughout your codebase.

Solving this problem is not trivial, since Gleece uses `go-playground/validator` for validation, which does not support automatic enum validation out of the box.

Therefore, we have added two experimental features to help with this issue, and we welcome your feedback on the best approach to take.

Feel free to contact us with feedback and suggestions.

### Validating Primitive Enum Parameters

This feature adds a validation layer for primitive parameters.

Set the `validateTopLevelOnlyEnum` to `true` in the `gleece.config.json` file:

```json
{
    "experimentalConfig": {
        "validateTopLevelOnlyEnum": true
    }
}
```

:::warning

This will validate only the top level (queries, headers, etc.) enum values, and not enums within structs.

:::

### Generated Enum Validators 

This feature adds build-time predefined validators for the enums used in your application.

The name of the validator will be formatted as snake case of the enum name with an `_enum` suffix.

For example, for the following enum:
```go
type MyOptions string

const (
    MyOptionsValue1 MyOptions = "value1"
    MyOptionsValue2 MyOptions = "value2"
)
```

The generated validator name will be `my_options_enum`.

You can use this validator as follows:
```go
type MyStruct struct {
    MyEnumField MyOptions `json:"myEnumField" validate:"required,my_options_enum"`
}
```

This will validate that the `MyEnumField` coming in is one of the predefined values and not just any string.

To enable this feature, set the `generateEnumValidator` to `true` in the `gleece.config.json` file:

```json
{
    "experimentalConfig": {
        "generateEnumValidator": true
    }
}
```
